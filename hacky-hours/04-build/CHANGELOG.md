## v0.1.0 — Unreleased

_MVP — Foundation slice in progress._

### Added

- Scaffolded Vite + React + TypeScript app at the repo root. `pnpm dev`,
  `pnpm build`, and `pnpm preview` are wired up.
- Enabled TypeScript strict mode and `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` across
  `tsconfig.app.json` and `tsconfig.node.json`.
- Added ESLint flat config with `typescript-eslint`, `eslint-plugin-react`,
  `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`, `eslint-plugin-react-refresh`, and
  `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`. Pinned to ESLint 9 (plugin ecosystem hasn't
  caught up to ESLint 10 yet). `pnpm lint` and `pnpm typecheck` scripts
  wired up.
